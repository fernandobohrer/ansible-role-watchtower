# Single Vagrant Box

This is a [Molecule][01] scenario called `svb` for *Single Vagrant Box*.

## ðŸš€ Motivation

This scenario can be used to test [Ansible][02] roles on a single [Vagrant][03] box running locally.

## ðŸ§° Dependencies

This scenario was tested and is confirmed to work properly when using the dependencies that are listed [here][04].

Besides the dependencies mentioned above, make sure to have [Vagrant][05] and [VirtualBox][06] installed on your machine.

## âš¡ Quick start

1. From within your Ansible role directory, execute the commands below:

    1. To create the virtual machine defined in the `molecule.yml` file:

        ```bash
        molecule create -s svb
        ```

    1. To execute the tasks defined in the `converge.yml` file on the created virtual machine:

        ```bash
        molecule converge -s svb
        ```

    1. To connect to the virtual machine defined in the `molecule.yml` file, use the virtual machines's name:

        ```bash
        molecule login -s svb -h debian-12
        ```

    1. Finally, to destroy the virtual machine:

        ```bash
        molecule destroy -s svb
        ```

    For additional information about the commands above, check the *Test sequence commands* section available in the [Molecule documentation][07].
